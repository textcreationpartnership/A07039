            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A man of worſhipp / to the men of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip / that is / Martin Marprelate gentleman / Primate / &amp; Metropolitane of all the Martins wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. To the Iohn of al the ſir Iohns / and to the reſt of the terrible prieſts: ſaith haue among you once againe my cleargie maſters. For</head>
            <p>O Brethren / there is ſuch a deal of loue growne of late I perceiue / betweene you and me / that although I would be negligent in ſending my Piſtles vnto you: yet I ſee you cannot forget me. I thought you to bee verye kinde when you ſent your Purcivaunts about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to ſeeke for me. But now that you your ſelues haue taken the paines to write / this is out of all crie. Why it paſſes to thinke what louing &amp; carefull brethren I haue / who although I cannot be gotten / to tell them where I am / becauſe I loue not the ayre of the Clinke or Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in this colde time of Winter / and by reaſon of my buſines in Piſtlemaking / will notwithſtanding make it knowne vnto the world / that they haue a moneths mind towards me. Now truly brethren / I find you kinde / why ye do not know what a pleaſure you haue done me. My worſhips books were vnknowne to many / before you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>T.C.</hi> to admoniſhe the people of England to take heed / that if they loued you / they woulde make much of their prelates / and the chiefe of the cleargie. Now many ſeeke after my bookes / more then euer they did. Againe / ſome knew not that our brother Iohn of Fulham / was ſo good vnto the porter of his gate / as to make the poore blinde honeſt ſoule / to be a dum miniſter. Many did not know / eyther that Amen / is as much as by my fayth / &amp; ſo that our Sauiour Chriſte euer ſware by his fayth: or that bowling and eating of the Sabboth / are of the ſame nature: that Bb. may as lawfully make blinde guydes / as Dauid might eate of the Shew bread: or that father Thomas tubtrimmer of Wincheſter / good old ſtudent / is a maſter of Arts of 45. yeares ſtanding. Many I ſay / 
<pb facs="tcp:12593:3"/> were ignorant of theſe thinges / and many other prettie toyes / vntil you wrote this prettie booke. Beſides what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ouerpaſſe in my writings / and did not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay / that I hope wilbe iudged to be true. And ſo Iohn a Bridges his treaſon out of the 448. page of his booke / you graunt to be true. Your ſelues you denie not to bee pettie popes. The B. of ſir Dauids in Wales / you denie not to haue two wiues / with an hundred other thinges which you do not gainſay: ſo that the reader may iudge that I am true of my worde / and vſe not to lye like Bb. And this hath greatly commended my worſhipps good dealing. But in your confutation of my book / you haue ſhewed reuerende Martin to be truepenie in deede: For you haue confyrmed / rather then confuted him. So that brethren / the pleaſure which you haue done vnto me / is out of all ſcotche and notche. And ſhoulde not I againe be as readie to pleaſure you? Naye / then I ſhoulde be as vngrateful towards my good brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / as Iohn of Cant. is to Thomas Cartwright. The which Iohn / although he hath bin greatly fauored by the ſaid Thomas / in that Thomas hath now theſe many yeares let him alone and ſaid nothing vnto him / for not anſwering his books / yet is not aſhamed to make a ſecrete compariſon / betweene himſelfe and Thomas Cartwright. As who ſay / Iohn of Lambehith / were as learned as Thomas Cartwright. What ſay you old deane Iohn a Bridges / haue not you ſhewed your ſelfe thankfull vnto hir Maieſtie / in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing hir ſupremacie in the 448. page of your booke. I will lay on load on your ſkincoat for this geare anon.</p>
            <p>And I will haue my penyworths of all of you brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ere I haue done with you / for this pains which your <hi>T.C</hi> hath taken with me. This is the puritans craft / in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to be confuted I knowe: Ile be euen with them to. A craftie whoreſons brethren Bb. did you thinke / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puritans <hi>T.C.</hi> did ſet Iohn of Cant, at a <hi>nonplus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12593:3"/> and gaue him the ouerthrow / that therefore your <hi>T.C.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias Thomas Cooper biſhop of Wincheſter / or Thomas Cooke his Chaplaine / could ſet me at a <hi>nonplus.</hi> Simple fellowes / me thinkes he ſhould not.</p>
            <p>I geſſe your <hi>T.C.</hi> to be Thomas Cooper (but I do not peremptorily affirme it) becauſe the modeſt olde ſtudent of 52. yeres ſtanding / ſetteth Wincheſter after Lincolne &amp; Rocheſter in the contents of his booke / which blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my / would not haue bin tollerated by them that ſaw and allowed the book / vnleſſe miſtres Coopers huſband had bin the author of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly / becauſe this <hi>T.C.</hi> the author of this booke is a biſhop / and therefore Thomas Cooper / he is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop / becauſe he reckoneth him ſelfe charged amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers / with thoſe crimes whereof non are accuſed but biſhops alone / pag. 101. lin. 26. Ha olde Martin yet I-ſee thou haſt it in thee / thou wilt enter into the bowels of the cauſe in hand I perceue. Nay if you wil commend me / I will giue you more reaſons yet. The ſtile and the phraſe is very like her huſbands / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſomtimes woont to write vnto doctor Day of Welles. You ſee I can do it in deed. Again / non would be ſo groſhead as to gather / becauſe my reuerence telleth Deane Iohn / that he ſhall haue twenty fiſts about his eares more then his owne (whereby I meant in deede / that manye would write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him / by reaſon of his bomination learning / which otherwiſe neuer ment to take pen hand) that I threatned him with blowes / and to deale by ſtafford law: Whereas that was far from my meaning / and could by no means be gathered out of my words / but only by him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Eulojin</hi> for <hi>Enlogeni</hi> in the pulpit: and by him whom a papiſt made to beleeue / that the greek word <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeni,</hi> that is to giue thanks / ſignifieth to make a croſſe in the forhead: py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / to thinke that an olde ſoaking
<pb facs="tcp:12593:4"/> ſtudent in this learned age / is not aſhamed to be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to preſume to deale with a papiſt / when he hath no grue in his pocked. But I promiſe you Sir / it is no ſhame to be a L. biſhop if a man could / thogh he were as vnlerned as Iohn of Gloceſter or William of Liechfeld. And I tel you true / our brother Weſtcheſter / had as liue playe twentie nobles in a night / at Priemeero on the cards / as trouble him ſelfe with any pulpit labor / and yet he thinks him ſelf to be a ſufficient biſhop. What a biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op ſuch a cardplaier? A biſhop play 20. nobles in a night? Whie a round threpence ſerueth the turn to make good ſport 3. or 4. nights amongſt honeſt neighbours. And take heede of it brother Weſtcheſter: it is an vnlawfull game if you will beleeue me. Foe / in winter it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take a litle ſport / for an od caſt braces of 20. nobles when the wether is foule / that men cannot go abroad to boules / or to ſhoote? What would you haue men take no recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Ye but it is an old ſaid ſaw / inough is as good as a feaſt.

               </gap>a maſter Martin Marprelate. I tel you true brother mine / though I haue as good a gift in piſtle making / as you haue at priemeero / and far more delight then you can haue at your cards / for the loue I beare to my brethren / yet I dare not vſe this ſport / but as a recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation / not making any trade therof.

You beſtowe not ful 50. pages in the anſweare of any thing that euer was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in print. The reſt are beſtowed to maintaine the belly / and to confute: what think you? Euen the ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inuentions of your owne braines for the moſt part.

In the confutation of theſe points / &amp; the ſcriptures corruptly aplied to proue them / there is beſtowed aboue an 100. pages of this book / that is / from the 149. vnto the end. Well <hi>T.C.</hi> whoſoeuer thou art / &amp; whoſoeuer Martin is / neither thou / nor any man or woman in England ſhal know while you liue / ſuſpect and trouble as many as you wil / and therefore ſaue your mony in ſeeking for him / for it may be he is neerer you then you are ware of.

Therefore (marke now <hi>T.C.</hi> and cary me this concluſion to Iohn O Lambehith for his breakefaſt) our church gouerment by Arch. and biſhops / is an vnlawful church gouerment. You ſee brother Cooper / that I am very courteous in my minor / for I deſire therein no more offices to bee thruſt out of the church at one time / but Archb. and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.

The minor of my laſt ſillogiſme / that whoſoeuer doth abolliſh the office of any lawfull thurch officer out of the church / he either maimeth or deformeth the church / I can proue with a wet finger. Becauſe euery lawful Churche officer / euen by reaſon of his office / is a member of the bodye of Chriſte Ieſus / whiche is the church / and being a member of the body / If the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth diſplace him by abolliſhing his office / and leaueth the place thereof voide / then the maieſtrate mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the body.

Becauſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtrate hath neither the ſkil nor the commiſſion / to make the members of the body of Chriſt. Becauſe he cannot tel to what vſe / the members of his making may ſerue in the church. Do you thinke <hi>T.C.</hi> that the maieſtrat may make an eie for the viſible body of the church. (For you muſt vnderſtand / that wee al this while ſpeake of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible body) can he make a foote or a hand for that body? I pray you in what place of the body would you haue them placed? If our Sauiour Chriſt hath left behind him a perfect body: ſurely he hath left therein no place or / no vſe for members of the maieſtrates making &amp; inuention: if an vnperfect and maimed body / I am wel aſſured that the maieſtrate is not able to perfect that which he left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed. But I hope <hi>T.C.</hi> that thou wilt not be ſo mad / and wicked / as to ſay that our Sauiour Chriſt / left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him heere on earth an vnperfect and maimed body. If not / then where ſhal theſe offices / namely theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers inuented by the maieſtrate be placed therein.</p>
               <p>Would you haue the naturall eies put out (as your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the biſhops haue don in the church of England / e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince Iohn of Canterbury vrged his wretched ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription) and vnnatural ſquint gogled eies put in their

What ſay you <hi>T.C.</hi> may the Maieſtrate cut of the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural legges / and handes of the body of Chriſte / vnder a pretence to put woodden in their ſteed. I hope you wil not ſay that he may. How then commeth it to paſſe <hi>T.C.</hi> that you hold Iohn of Canterbury his office / and Iohn Mar-elms to be true and natural members of the body / that is true officers of the church / and yet hold it laweful for her Maieſtie to diſplace them out of the church. I-cannot tel brother what you hold in this point. Me think I haue diſturbed your ſences. Do you thinke that the maieſtrat may diſplace the true members of the body of Chriſt / and place woodden in their ſteed. Why this is to hold it lawful for the maieſtrate to maſſacre the body. Do you thinke he may not? Then may not her maieſtie diſplace Iohn of Canterburies office out of our church: if ſhee may not diſplace his office / then either he by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his office / is a lawfull Pope aboue all ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates / or els the Church gouernment is ſo preſcribed in the word / as it is not lawfull for the mageſtrate to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame. But Iohn of Canterburie / as the puritans their ſelues confeſſe / is no Pope.<note place="margin">Puritans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes Iohn Cant. to be no Pope.</note> Then either the church gouernment is ſo preſcribed in the word as it may not be altred / or els the mageſtrat may aboliſh a lawful church gouernement / and place another in ſtead thereof. If the Church gouernment be ſo preſcribed in the worde / as it cannot be altered / then either our gouernment is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame which was therein preſcribed / or our Church gouerment is a falſe Churchgouerment.

Therefore our Church gouernment is not that which is preſcribed in the word: and therfore a falſe and vnlawfull church gouernement. If you thinke that the magiſtrate may diſplace the lawful offices of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die / then as I ſaid before / you hold it lawfull for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to maime or deforme the bodie. Becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he pulleth in the roome of the true and right mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers / muſt needs be a deformitie / and what place ſoeuer he leaueth vnfurniſhed of a member / muſt needes be a maime. And this is the onely and ſole office of Chriſte onely / to place and diſplace the members of his bodie: to wit / the officers of his Church / he may lawfully do it / ſo cannot man. And therefore the ſots (of which nomber you <hi>T.C.</hi> and you Iohn Whitgift / and you Deane Iohn / and you D. Cooſins / and you D. Copcot / with the reſt of the ignoraunt and wretched defendors of our corrupt church gouernement are to be accounted) which thinke that the offices of paſtors / doctors / elders and deacons / or the moſt of them / may be aſwell nowe wanting in the Church / as the offices of Apoſtles / prophets and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: do notably bewray their vile ignorance / but the cauſe they doe not hurt. For the beaſtes do not conſider that the offices of Apoſtles / Euangeliſts and Prophets / were remoued out of the church / not by man / but by the Lord / becauſe hee in his wiſdome did not ſee any vſe of ſuch members in his body / after the time of the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting of the Churche.<note place="margin">The apoſtles choſe non in fled of Iames being beheded as they did in ſteed of Iudas Act. 1. which they would haue don if the apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12593:11"/> lawfully or vnlawfully aboliſhed out of the Churche / if lawfully / then they were aboliſhed by the Lord: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are neither to be called backe vntill he ſheweth it to be his pleaſure that it ſhoulde be ſo / neither can the church be truely ſaid to be maimed for want of them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he which could beſt tell / what members were fitte for his Churche did aboliſhe them. If vnlawfully / then thoſe callings may be lawfully called backe againe into the church / &amp; the church without them is maimed / that is / wanteth ſome members.

But they are not iniuriouſly kept out (for ſo her Maieſtie ſhoulde be ſaid to iniurie the church / vnleſſe ſhe would ſee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles / prophets and Euangeliſts / planted therein) neither can the church be ſaide to be maimed for want of them / becauſe the Lorde by taking them away hath declared / that now there can be no vſe of them in the bodie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde abrogated them. Therefore alſo they may be wanting / &amp; the churche neither maimed nor deformed thereby. Whereas the keeping out of eyther of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offices of paſtors / doctors / elders and deacons / is a maiming of the churche / the placing of others in their ſteed / a deforming.

               <p>Therefore looke Rom. 12. verſ. 4.5. &amp;c. and there you ſhall ſee / that whoſoeuer hath an office in the bodie / is a member of the bodie. There alſo you ſhall ſee / that he that teacheth / which is the Doctor: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exhorteth / which is the Paſtor: he that ruleth / which is the Elder: he that diſtributeth / which is the Deacon (as for him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercie that is there ſpoken off / he is but a church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant / and no church officer) There I ſay / you ſhall alſo ſee / that theſe 4. offices / of Paſtors / Doctors / Eleders &amp; Deacons / are members of the bodie: and 1.

Firſt / that the platforme of gouernment / by Paſtors / Doctors / Elders and deacons / which you ſay was deuiſed you knowe not by whom / is the inuention of our Sauiour Chriſt.

               <p>Fourthly that euery chriſtian mageſtrate is bound to receue this gouernment / by Paſtors / Doctors / Elders &amp; deacons into the church / within his dominions / whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer inconuenience may be likely to follow the receuing of it.

               <p>Fiftly that the gouerment of the church by Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and biſhops / is a gouernment of deformed and vnſhapen members / ſeruing for no good vſe in the church of God.

                  <hi>That you muſt needs be, not onely traytors to God and his word, but alſo enemies vnto hir Maieſtie and the land, in defending the eſtabliſhed Church gouernment to be lawfull.</hi>

               <p>You ſee the accuſation which I lay to your charge / and here followeth the proofe of it.

I may haue my wants I know. For I am a man. But my courſe I knowe to be ordinary and lawfull. I ſawe the cauſe of Chriſts gouernment / and of the Biſhops Antichriſtian dealing to be hidden.

                  </gap> and againſt the other. I bethought mee therefore / of a way whereby men might be drawne to do both / percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the humors of men in theſe times (eſpecialy of thoſe that are in any place) to be giuen to mirth. I tooke that courſe. I might lawfully do it. I / for ieſting is lawful by circumſtances / euen in the greateſt matters. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time / place and perſons vrged me thereunto. I neuer profaned the word in any ieſt. Other mirth I vſed as a couert / wherin I would bring the truth into light. The Lord being the authour both of mirth and grauitie / is it not lawfull in it ſelfe / for the trueth to vſe eyther of theſe wayes / when the circumſtances do make it lawful?</p>
               <p>My purpoſe was and is to do good. I know I haue don no harme howſoeuer ſom may iudg Martin to mar al. They are very weake one that ſo think. In that which I haue written I know vndoubtedly / that I haue done the Lord and the ſtate of this kingdom great ſeruice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue in ſom ſort / diſcouered the greateſt enemies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12593:13"/> thereof. And by ſo much the moſt peſtilent enemies / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wound Gods relligion / and corrupt the ſtate with Atheiſm and looſnes / and ſo cal for Gods vengance vppon vs all / euen vnder the coulor of relligion. I affirm them to be the greateſt enemies that now our ſtate hath / for if it were not for them / the trueth ſhould haue more free paſſage herein / then now it hath. All ſtates thereby would be amended: and ſo we ſhould not be ſubiect vnto Gods diſpleaſure / as now we are by reaſon of them.</p>
               <p>Nowe let me deale with theſe that are in authority. I do make it knowne vnto them / that our biſhops are the greateſt enemies which we haue. For they do not only go about / but they haue long ſince / fully perſwaded our ſtate / that they may lawfully procure the Lord / to take the ſword in hand againſt the ſtate: if this be true / haue I not ſaid truly / that they are the greteſt enemies which our ſtate hath. The papiſtes work no ſuch effect / for they are not truſted. The Atheiſtes haue not infected our whol ſtate / theſe haue. The attempts of our forraine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may be pernicious. But they are men as wee are. But that God / which when our biſhops haue / and doe make our prince / and our gouernors to wadge war / who is able to ſtand againſt him?</p>
               <p>Wel to the point / many haue put her maieſtie / the parliament &amp; counſell in minde / that the church officers now among vs / are not ſuch as the Lord aloweth of: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of his owne ordaininge. They haue ſhewed that this falt is to be amended / or the Lords hand to be looked for. The biſhops on the otherſide / haue cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out vpon them / that haue thus dutifully mooued the ſtate. They with a loud voice gaue out / that the maieſtrat may lawfully maintaine that church gouerment / which beſt fitteth our eſtate / as liuing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of peace. What do they elſe herein / but ſay that the mageſtrat in time of peace / may maime and deforme the body of Chriſt his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12593:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> church. That Chriſt hath left the gouerment of his own houſe vnperfect / and left the ſame to the diſcretion of the mageſtrate / wheras Moſes before whome in this point of gouernment / the Lord Chriſt is iuſtly preferred / Heb. 3.6. made the gouernment of the legal politie ſo perfcet / as he left not any parte thereof / to the diſcretion of the mageſtrate. Can they deny church officers / to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church. They are refuted by the expreſſe text. 1. Cor. 12. will they affirme Chriſt to haue left behinde him an vnperfect body of his church / wanting members at the leſt wiſe / hauing ſuch members as were only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent at the mageſtrates pleaſure. Why Moſes the ſeruant / otherwiſe gouerned the houſe in his time. And the ſonne is commended in this point for wiſdome / and faithfulnes before him. Heb 3.6. Either then / that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the ſonn before the ſeruant / is a falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony / or the ſonne ordained a permanent gouernment in his church. If permanent / not to be changed. What then / do they that hold it may be changed at the mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates pleaſure / but aduiſe the maieſtrate by his poſitiue lawes / to proclaime that it is his will / that if there ſhalbe a church within his dominions / he will maime and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame. He wil ordaine therein / what members he thinketh good. He will make it knowne / that Chriſt vnder his gouernment / ſhalbe made leſſe faithfull then Moſes was. That he hath left the placing of members in his body vnto the mageſtrate. O curſed beaſtes / that bring this guilt vppon our eſtate. Repent Caitifes while you haue time. You ſhal not haue it I feare when you wil. And looke you that are in authority vnto the equity of the controuerſie / betwene our wicked biſhops / and thoſe who woulde haue the diſorders of our Churche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Take heed you be not caried away with ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Chriſts gouerment is neither Mar-prince / Mar-ſtate / Mar-law nor Mar-magiſtrate. The liuing God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12593:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> whoſe cauſe is pleaded for / will bee reuenged of you / if you giue eare vnto this ſlander / contrary to ſo many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies as are brought out of his word / to prooue the contrary. He denounceth his wrath againſt all you / that thinke it lawfull for you / to maim or deform his church: he accounteth his Churche maimed / when thoſe offices are therein placed / whiche hee hath not appointed to be members thereof: he alſo teſtifieth that there be no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his appointment in the Churche / but ſuch as he himſelfe hath named in his word / and thoſe that he hath named / man muſt not diſplace / for ſo he ſhoulde put the bodie out of ioynt. Nowe our biſhops holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary / and bearing you in hande / that you may practize the contrary / do they not driue you to prouoke the Lorde to anger againſt your owne ſoules? And are they not your enemies? They hold the contrary I ſay / for they ſay that her Maieſtie may alter this gouernment now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed / and thereby they ſhew either this gouerment to be vnlawfull / or that the magiſtrat may preſume to place thoſe members in Gods Church / which the Lord neuer mentioned in his word. And I beſeech you marke howe the caſe ſtandeth betweene theſe wretches / &amp; thoſe whom they call puritans.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The puritans (falſely ſo called) ſhew it to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the magiſtrate / to goe about to make any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for the bodie of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They hold all officers of the Church / to be members of the bodie / Rom. 12.6. 1. cor. 12.8.28.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And therfore they hold the altering / or the aboliſhing of the offices of church gouernment / to be the altering &amp; aboliſhing of the members of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The altering &amp; aboliſhing of which members / they holde to be vnlawfull / becauſe it muſt needs be a maime vnto the bodie.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They hold Chriſt Ieſus to haue ſet downe as exact /

               <p>Now I demand / whether they that hold the contrary in theſe pointes / and cauſe the State to practize the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary / be not outragious wicked men / and dangerous e / nemies of the ſtate / it cannot be denied but they are. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contrarie practize of any the former points / is a way to worke the ruine of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Now our Biſhopps holde the contrary vnto them al / ſaue the 3. and 2. points / whereunto it may be they will yeeld / &amp; cauſe our eſtate to practize the contrary: whence at the length / our deſtruction is like to proceed. For</p>

               <p n="2">2 In holding all offices of the Church to be members of the bodie / (for if they be not members / what ſhoulde they do in the body) they hold it lawful for the magiſtrat to attempt the making of new members for that bodie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The altering or abolliſhing of theſe members by the magiſtrates / they holde to be lawfull. And therefore the maiming or deforming.</p>

               <p>The ſinful / the vnlawful / the broken / vnnatural / falſe and baſtardly gouernors of the church / to wit archb. and biſhops / which abuſe euen their falſe offices / are ſpoken againſt. Therefore the true / natural and lawful / and iuſt gouernors of the common welth / ſhalbe likewiſe ſhortly miſliked. Ah ſenceleſſe and vndutifull beaſtes / that dare compare your ſelues with our true mageſtrates / which are the ordinaunces of God / with your ſelues / that is / with Archbiſhops and biſhops / which as you your ſelues confeſſe (I will by and by proue this) are the ordinances of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>I knowe I am diſliked of many which are your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies / that is of many which you cal puritans. It is their weaknes / I am threatened to be hanged by you. What though I were hanged / do you thinke your cauſe ſhalbe the better. For the day that you hange Martin / aſſure your ſelues / there wil 20. Martins ſpring in my place. I meane not now you groſſe beaſtes / of any commotion as profane <hi>T.C.</hi> like a ſenſles wretch / not able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12593:16"/> an Engliſh phraſe / hath giuen out vpon that which he calleth the threatning of fiſtes. Aſſure your ſelues / I wil proue Marprelat ere I haue don with you. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. No man vnder heauen is priuy / or hath bin priuie vnto my writings againſt you / I vſed the aduiſe of non therein. You haue and do ſuſpect diuers, as maſter Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett / maſter Wiggington / maſter Vdall / &amp; maſter Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri / &amp;c. to make Martin. If they cannot cleare their ſelues their ſillineſſe is pitifull / and they are worthy to beare Martins puniſhment. Well once againe anſwere my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons / both of your Antichriſtian places in my firſt epiſtle vnto you / and theſe nowe vſed againſt you. Otherwiſe the wiſdome of the magiſtrate muſt needs ſmel what you are. And cal you to a reckoning / for deceauing them ſoe long / making them to ſuffer the church of Chriſt vnder their gouernment to be maimed and deformed.</p>
               <p>Your reaſons for the defence of your hierarchie / and the keeping out of Chriſts gouernment / vſed by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <hi>T.C.</hi> are already anſwered. They ſhew what profane beaſtes you are. I wil heere repete them. But heere firſt the reader is to know what anſwere this <hi>T.C.</hi> maketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſyllogiſmes / whereby I prooue all L. biſhops to be petty popes / and petty Antichriſtes. I aſſure you no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this / he flattly denieth the coicluſion / wheras he might (if he had any learning in him / or had read any thing) know / that euery dunſtical logician / giueth this for an inuiolable precept / that the concluſion is not to be denied. For that muſt needs be true / if the maior and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be true / he in omitting the maior and minor / becauſe he was not able to anſwere thereby / granteth the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be true. His anſweare vnto the concluſion is / that al lord Gb. were not pety popes. Becauſe pag. 74. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer / Ridly / Hooper / were not petty Popes. They were not pety popes / becauſe they were not reprobates. As though you block you / euery petty pope and petty Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12593:17"/> were a reprobate. Why no man can deny Gregory the great / to be a pettye Pope / and a petty &amp; petty Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For he was the next immediate pope before Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the firſt / that knowne Antichriſt: and yet this Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory left behind him / vndoubted teſtimonies of a choſen childe of God: ſo might they / &amp; yet be petty Popes / in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of their office. Profane <hi>T.C.</hi> his 1. and 2. reaſon / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawfulnes of our church gouerment. And what though good men gaue their conſent vnto our church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / or writing vnto biſhops / gaue them their lordly ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? Are their offices therefore lawfull / then ſoe is the popes office. For Eraſmus was a good man you cannot deny / and yet he both alowed of the popes office ſince his calling / and writing vnto him / gaue him his titles. So did Luther / ſince his calling alſo / for he dedicated his booke of chriſtian liberty vnto pope Leo the tenth. The booke &amp; his Epiſtle vnto the Pope / are both in Engliſhe. Here I would wiſh the magiſtrat / to marke what good reaſons you are able to afford for your hierarchie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly / ſaith profane <hi>T.C.</hi> page 75. All Churches haue not the gouernment of Paſtors and Doctors: but Saxoni and Denmake / haue L. biſhops. You are a great State man vndoubtedly <hi>T.C.</hi> that vnderſtand / the ſtate of other Churches ſo well. But herein the impudencie of a proude foole appeareth egregiouſly. As though the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of a ſiely Schoolemaſter / being alſo as vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / as a man of that trade and profeſſion can be / with any honeſtie / would be belieued againſt knowne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Yea / but Saxonie and Denmarke haue Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents / what then? ergo L. Archb. and biſhops? I deny it. Though other Churches had L. Archb. and Bb. this prooueth nothing els / but that other Churches are mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and haue their imperfections. Your reaſon is this / other good Churches are deformed / therefore ours muſt needes be ſo to. The kings ſonne is lame / therefore the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12593:17"/> children of no ſubiects muſt go vpright. And theſe be all the good reaſons which you can bring for the gouerment of Archb. and biſhops / againſt the gouerment of Chriſt. You reſon thus. It muſt not be admitted into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome / becauſe then Ciuillians ſhal not be able to liue / in that eſtimation / and welth / wherein they now do. Carnal and ſenſles beaſtes / whoe are not aſhamed to prefer / the outward eſtate of men / before the glory of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Here againe / let the mageſtrate and other readers conſider / whether it be not time / that ſuch brutiſh men / ſhould be looked vnto. Which reaſon thus. The body of Chriſt which is the church / muſt needes be maimed and deformed in this common welth / becauſe otherwiſe ciuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians ſhould not be able to liue. Why you enemies to the ſtate / you traytors to God and his worde / you Mar-prince / Mar-law / Mar-mageſtrate / Mar-church / and Mar-common welth: do you not know that the worlde ſhould rather go a begging / then that the glory of god by maiming his church / ſhould be defaced? Who can abide this indignity. The prince and ſtate / muſt procure god to wrath againſt them / by continuing the deformity of his church / and it may not be otherwiſe / becauſe the ciuilians els muſt fall to decay. I wil tel you what / you monſtrous &amp; vngodly biſhops / though I had no feare of God before mine eies / and had no hope of a better life / yet the loue that I owe / as a natural man / vnto her maieſtie and the ſtate would inforce me to write againſt you: her maieſtie and this kingdome / (whome the Lord bleſſe / with his mighty hand / I vnfainedly beſeech) muſt endanger them ſelues vnder the peril of Gods heauy wrath / rather then the maime of our church gouernment muſt be healed / for we had rather it ſhould be ſo / ſay our biſhops / then wee ſhould be thruſt out / for if we ſhould be thruſt out / the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the ciuil lawe / muſt needs goe to wrack. Well / if I had liued ſometimes a citizen / in that olde and auncient

I woulde ſurely / in the loue I ought to the ſafetie of that ſtate / haue called him that had vſed ſuch a ſpeech / in <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium capitis,</hi> whoſoeuer he had bin: and I woulde not haue doubted to haue giuen him the ouerthrow. And ſhal I being a chriſtian Engliſh ſubiect / abide to heare a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked crue of vngodly biſhopps / with their hangones and paraſites / affirme that our Queene / and our State / muſt needs be ſubiect vnto the greateſt daunger that may be / vz. the wrath of God / for deforming his Church / and that Gods Church muſt needes be maimed and deformed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs / becauſe otherwiſe / a few Ciuillians ſhal not be able to liue. Shall I heare and ſee theſe thinges profeſſed and publiſhed / and in the loue I owe vnto Gods religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and her Maieſty / ſay nothing. I cannot / I will not / I may not be ſilent at this ſpeech: come what will come of it. The loue of a chriſtian Church / prince and ſtate / ſhal I truſt / worke more in me / then the loue of a heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and ſtate ſhould do. Now iudge good reader / who is more tollerable in a commonwealth / Martin that would haue the enemies of her Maieſty remoued thence / or our biſhops which would haue her life / and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes proſperitie hazarded / rather then a few Ciuillians ſhould want maintenance. But I praye thee tell me <hi>T.C.</hi> why ſhould the gouernment of Chriſt impoueriſh Ciuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians? Becauſe ſaith he / pag. 77. the Canon law by which they liue / muſt be altered / if that were admitted. Yea but Ciuillians liue by the court of Amraltie / &amp; other courts as well as by the Arches / vz. alſo the probatts of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments / the controuerſies of tythes / matrimonie / and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12593:18"/> other cauſes / which you biſhops Mar-ſtate / do vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly take from the ciuill magiſtrate / would be a means of Ciuillians maintenance. But are not you aſhamed / to profeſſe your whole gouernment / to be a gouernment ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Popes Canon lawes / which are banniſhed by ſtatute out of this kingdome? This notably ſheweth that you are Mar-prince and Mar-ſtate. For howe dare you retaine theſe lawes / vnles by vertue of them / you meane eyther to enforce the ſupremacie of the prince to go again to Rome / or to come to Lambeth. It is treſon by Statute / for any ſubiect in this land / to proceed doctor of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law / and dare you profeſſe your church gouerment to be ruled by that law. As though one ſtatute might not refer all matters of the Canon law / vnto the temporall &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of this Realme: and is this all you can ſay / <hi>T.C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes ſayth he / the gouernment of Chriſte / would bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the iudiciall law of Moſes. As much as is morrall of that law / or of the equitie of it / would be brought in. And do you gaineſay it. But you ſodden headed Aſſe you / the moſt part of that law is abrogated. Some part thereof is in force among vs / as the puniſhment of a murtherer by death / and preſumptuous obſtinate theft by death / &amp;c. Hir <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Maieſties prerogatiue in eccleſiaſtical cauſes / ſhould not be a whit diminiſhed / but rather greatly ſtrengthened by Chriſts gouernment. And no lawe ſhould be altered / but ſuch as were contrary to the lawe of God / &amp; againſt the profit of the common wealth: and therefore there can be no danger in altering theſe.</p>
               <p>The miniſters maintenance by tythe / no puritane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to be vnlawfull. For Martin (good M.

               <p>The inconuenience which you ſhew of the gouerment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which is that men would not be ruled by it / is anſwered afore. And I praye you / why ſhould they not be better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The lawes of Englande haue bene made / when there was neuer a biſhop in the Parliament / as in the firſt yere of her Maieſtie.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The gouerment of the church of Chriſt / is no popular gouernement / but it is Monarchicall / in regarde of our head Chriſt / Ariſtocraticall in the Elderſhip / and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall in the people. Such is the ciuill gouernement of our kingdome: Monarchicall in her Maieſties perſon: Ariſtocraticall in the higher houſe of Parliament / or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Councell table: Democraticall in the bodie of the commons of the lower houſe of Parliament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profane <hi>T.C.</hi> this gouernment ſeeketh no popularity to be brought into the Church: much leſſe entendeth the alteration of the ciuill ſtate / that is but your ſlaunder / of which you make an occupation. And I will ſurely paye you for it. I muſt be brief now / but more warke for Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhall examine your ſlaunders. They are nothing elſe but prooffes / that as by your owne confeſſions you are biſhops of the Diuell / ſo you are enemies vnto the ſtate. For by theſe ſlaunders / you go about to blinde our ſtate / that they may neuer ſee a perfect regiment of the Church in our dayes. I ſaye / that by your owne confeſſion / you are biſhops of the Diuell. I will prooue it thus. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that your Lordly gouernment / were not lawfull and tollerable in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth / if her Maieſty &amp; the ſtate of the land did diſclaime the ſame. Tell me / doe you not confeſſe this. Denie it if you dare. For will you ſay / that you ought lawfully to be here in our commonwelth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Maieſty and the Counſell wil or no: Is this the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12593:19"/> thankes that her Maieſtie ſhall haue / for tollerating you in her kingdome all this while / that nowe you will ſaye / that you and your places ſtand not in this kingdome by her curteſie / but you haue as good right vnto your pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / as ſhe hath vnto her kingdome. And by this meanes your offices ſtande not by her good liking / and the good liking of the ſtate / as do the offices of our L. high Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor / high Treaſurer / and high Steward of Englande. But your offices ought to ſtand &amp; to be in force / in ſpight of her Maieſtie / the Parliament / Counſell / and euerie man els / vnles they woulde doe you iniury. Soe that I know / I / you dare not deny but that your offices weare vnlawfull in our common wealth / if her Maieſtie the Parliament / and the Counſell woulde haue them abolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If you grant this / then you doe not hold your offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as from God / but as from man. Her maieſtie ſhe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hir office / and her kingdome / as from God / and is beholding for the ſame / vnto no prince nor ſtate vnder he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Your caſe is otherwiſe / for you hold your offices as from her Maieſtie / &amp; not from god. For otherwiſe / you needed not to be any more beholding vnto her Maieſtie for the ſame in regarde of right / then ſhe is bounde to be beholding vnto other ſtates in regarde of her right: and ſo you in regarde of your Lordly ſuperioritie / are not the biſhops of god / but as Ierom ſayth / the biſhops of man. And this the moſt of you confes to be true / and you ſee how dangerous it woulde be for you / to affirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: namely / that you holde your offices as from god. Well ſir / if you ſay that you are the biſhops of man. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tell me whether you like of Dean Iohn his booke.<note place="margin">T.C. 38.</note> O yes ſayth <hi>T.C.</hi> For his grace did peruſe that book / &amp; we know the ſufficiencie of it to be ſuch / as the Puritans are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anſwere it. Well then / whatſoeuer is in this booke is authenticall. It is ſo / ſaith <hi>T.C.</hi> otherwiſe / his grace would not haue alowed it. What ſay you then to the 140.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12593:20"/> page of that booke / where he ſaith / (anſwering the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the biſhop of God / the biſhop of Man / and the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Diuell) that there is no biſhopp of man at all / but euerie B. muſt be either the Biſhopp of God / or the Biſhop of the Diuel. He alſo affirmeth / none to be the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of god / but he which hath warrant / both incluſiuely and alſo expreſly in gods word.<note place="margin">Deane Iohn, lib. 4. page 340. line 7.</note> Now you Biſhops of the Diuell / what ſay you now / are you ſpighted of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans / becauſe you like good ſubiects dofend the lawes of her Maieſtie / or els becauſe like incarnate Diuells / you are biſhops of the Diuells / as you your ſelues confeſſe.</p>
               <p>Here againe / let the Magiſtrate once more conſider / what peſtilent and daungerous beaſts theſe wretches are vnto the ciuill ſtate. For either by their owne confeſſion / they are the Biſhops of the Diuell (and ſo by that means will be the vndoing of the ſtate / if they be continued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) or elſe their places ought to be in this commonwealth whether her Maieſtie and our ſtate will or no: becauſe they are not (as they ſay) the biſhops of man / that is / they haue not their ſuperioritie / and their Lordly callings ouer their brethren by humane conſtitution / as my LL. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor / Treaſurer / and other honorable perſonages haue / but by diuine ordinance. Yea / &amp; their callings / they holde (as you haue heard) not onely to be incluſiuely / but alſo expreſlie in the word. What ſhifte will they vſe to auoyde this point? Are they the Biſhopps of men / that is / holde they their iuriſdiction as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men. No ſaith Deane Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / no ſayth Iohn of Canterburie and the reſt of them / (for all of them allowe this booke of Iohn Bridges) for then we are the biſhops of the deuill / we cannot auoid it? Are they then the biſhops of God / that is / haue they ſuch a calling as the Apoſtles / Euangeliſtes / &amp;c. had: that is / ſuch a calling as ought lawfully to be in a chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth (vnleſſe the magiſtrate woulde iniurie the Church / yea maime / deforme / and make a monſter of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12593:20"/> Church) whether the magiſtrate will or no. We haue ſay they. For our callings are not onely incluſiuely / but alſo expreſſely in the worde. So that by Deane Bridges his confeſſion / and the approbation of Iohn Canterburie / ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our biſhops are biſhops of the diuel / or their callings cannot be defended lawful / without flat and plaine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / in ouerthrowing her Maieſties ſupremacie. And ſo Deane Bridges hath written / and Iohn Whitgift hath approoued and allowed / flat treaſon to be publiſhed.</p>
               <p>Is Martin to be blamed for finding out and diſcouering traitors? Is he to be blamed for crying out againſt the Bb. of the Diuel. If he be / then in deed haue I offended in writing againſt biſhops? If not / whether is the better ſubiect Martin or our biſhops: whether I be fauored or no / I wil not ceaſe / in the loue I owe to her Maieſtie / to write againſt traitors / to write againſt the Diuels biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. Our biſhops are ſuch by their owne confeſſion. For they proteſt them ſelues to be biſhopps of the Diuel. If they ſhould holde the preheminence to be from man / If they hold it otherwiſe then from man / they are traytors. And vntil this beaſt Docter Gridges wrote this booke / they neuer as yet durſt preſume to claim their Lordſhips any otherwiſe lawful then from her maieſtie / yea and D. Bridges about the 60. page ſaith the ſame. But they care not what contrariety they haue in their writings / what treaſon they hold / as long as they are perſwaded that no man ſhalbe tollerated to write againſt them. I haue once already ſhewed treaſon to be in this booke of the Deane of Sarum / page. 448. I ſhew the like now to be pag. 340. Becauſe Deane Bridges durſt not anſweare me. They haue turned vnto me in his ſtead / a beaſt whome by the length of his cares / I geſſe to be his brother / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is / an Aſſe of the ſame kinde. But I wil be anſwered of the Deane him ſelfe in this and the former point of treaſon / or elſe / his cloiſter ſhal ſmoake for it. And thus profane <hi>T.C.</hi> you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12593:21"/> perceue what a good ſubiect you are / in defending the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed gouernment. Thus alſo I haue anſwered all your booke in the matters of the lawfulnes of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Paſtors / Doctors / Elders and Deacons / and the vnlawfulnes of our baſtardly Church gouernment / by archbiſhops and biſhops / where alſo the reader may ſee / that if euer there was a church rightly gouerned / that is a church without maime or deformity / the ſame was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Paſtors / Doctors / elders and deacons.</p>
               <p>whan / whan / but where haue I bin al this while. Ten to one among ſome of theſe puritans. Why Martin? Why Martin I ſay / haſt tow forgotten thy ſelfe? Where haſt ti bene / why man / cha bin a ſeeking for a Samons neſt / and cha vound a whol crue / either of eccleſiaſticall traitors / or of biſhops of the Diuel / of broken and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed members of the church: neuer winke on me good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low / for I will ſpeke the truth / lett the puritans doe what they can. I ſay then that they are broken members / and I ſay Iohn of Canterbury if he be a member of the church / I ſay he is a broken member / and that Thomas of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter is a Cholerick member. Yea and cha vound that profane <hi>T. C.</hi> is afraid left her Maieſtie ſhoulde giue Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops liuings away from them. And therefore ſhutteth his booke with this poſition / vz. That it is not lawful to beſtow ſuch liuings vppon lay men / as are appointed by Gods law vppon miniſters.

But good <hi>T.C.</hi> is it poſſible to finde worſe then we haue. I do not maruel though thou calleſt me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller / when thou dareſt abuſe the Prophets farre worſe / then in calling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libeliers: for I tel thee true / thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not haue anye way ſo ſtayned their good names / as thou haſt done / in comparing them to our biſhopps. Call me Libeller as often as thou wilt / I do not greatly care: but and thou loueſt me / neuer liken me to our biſhops of the diuell. For I cannot abide to be compared vnto thoſe. For by thine owne compariſon / in the 9. page / they are iuſt Balaams vp and downe.</p>
